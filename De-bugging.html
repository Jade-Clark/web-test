            <h2>A fun paper plane making activity:</h3>

            <p>If you're looking for printable instructions to make a paper plane, this resource is just what you need. </p>

            <p>It includes step by step instructions with pictures to help your children make their own paper plane. You could use this as a fun way to teach Maths or Physics and have your kids consider measurements and flight-path to see how far they can make their paper plane fly. </p>

                <li>Fold the outer edges in again to meet at the centre fold. </li>
 
                <li>Turn the paper over and then fold it in half in the middle. </li>
 
                <li>Fold down the wings on each side so that they meet with the bottom of the plane. </li>

            <p><em>Did the paper or the real aeroplane come first? </em></p>

            <quote>It's not 100% clear who came up with the first paper aeroplane - some credit <a href="url">Leonardo Da Vinci</ahref>, some credit the ancient Chinese - but it certainly came before the real aeroplane, which was invented in 1903 with the Wright Brothers.</quote>
