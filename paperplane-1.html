<h2><strong>A fun paper plane making activity:</strong></h2>
<p>If you're looking for printable instructions to make a paper plane, this resource is just what you need.</p><br>
It includes step by step instructions with pictures to help your children make their own paper plane. You could use this as a fun way to teach Maths or Physics and have your kids consider measurements and flight-path to see how far they can make their paper plane fly.
<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>a piece of A4-sized paper</li>
    <li>Opposable thumbs</li>
</ul><br>

<strong>Let's Begin</strong>
<p><ol>
    <li>Make a line in the centre by folding the paper in half longways then opening it out flat.</li><br>
    <li>Fold in two of the corners so they meet at the centre fold.</li><br>
    <li>Fold the outer edges in again to meet at the centre fold.</li><br>
    <li>Turn the paper over and then fold it in half in the middle.</li><br>
    <li>Fold down the wings on each side so that they meet with the bottom of the plane.</li><br>
    <li>Your plane is ready to fly! How far can you make it go?</li>

     <p><em>Did the paper or the real aeroplane come first?</em></p>
     <p>It's not 100% clear who came up with the first paper aeroplane - some credit<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"><u>Leonardo Da Vinci,</u></span> some credit the ancient Chinese - but it certainly came before the real aeroplane, which was invented in 1903 with the Wright Brothers.</p>
